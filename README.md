## Contributing

There are two ways to contribute. If you're fluent in another language, you could
head over to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/cah-creator/cah-creator) and
help us translate. Otherwise, if you're fluent in Ruby, you could help us code.

### Translating

We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/cah-creator/cah-creator) for translations.
Right now, we are focusing on French translations, as this is the top second language
(from Google Analytics). If you'd like to translate in another language though,
it would be much appreciated! (I will also give you free premium!)

If your language doesn't exist on the Transifex page, please [let me know](mailto:me+cahcreator@tjhorner.com).

**Translators:**

### Coding

If you know a bit about Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework, you could help us
out there. If you notice a bug and are sure of how to fix it, don't hesitate to
send over a PR! If the bug was severe enough, I might give you premium as well.

If you're fluent in JavaScript or Node.js, head over to the
[cah-creator-socket](/CAHCreator/cah-creator-socket) project. That's written in
Node with Socket.io and handles all of the temporary sessions and stuff.

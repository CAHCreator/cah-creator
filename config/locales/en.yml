All donations will go directly to the account I use to pay Heroku (and if there are any leftovers, I might get a cup of coffee)."
  donate_benefits: "There aren't really any benefits right now, other than me being grateful, but I might soon add some sort of perk, but right now it just helps the site stay up. If you want benefits, you should check out Premium!"
